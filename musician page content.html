<p><strong> Stokes-Nicholson Big Band</strong></p>
<a href="musician's.html#Stokes-Nicholson Big Band"></a><img src="images/Stokes-Nicholson Big Band.jpg" alt="Stokes-Nicholson Big Band"/>
<p>The Stokes-Nicholson Big Band was formed in 199 by Roy Stokes and Les Nicholson. Roy wanted to create an opportunity to keep experienced musicians playing challenging music so their talents didn't go rusty. Les came from a different perspective of wanting to provide an opportunity for music students of all ages to sit beside experienced jazz musicians.
The Stokes Nicholson Big Band was meeting once a month for rehearsals.
Sadly Roy passed away on 1st January 1993 after a period of illness. Les continued to manage the band and conduct rehearsals, as well as playing first trumpet. In 1997 he enlisted the help of John Ruffle who took on the role of Musical Director, allowing Les to relax a little.<br> 
<br>The band today demonstrates it has achieved the aims of both Roy and Les with experienced musicians arriving in town and feeling very proud to join such a powerful big band. A number of the original student members from 1991 are still in the band and have now joined the ranks of the experienced musicians and new students are still progressing from school bands to the Stokes Nicholson Big Band.
